# ExileTradeLens

**ExileTradeLens** is a hybrid price checker for Path of Exile (PoE 1 and 2) primarily for macOS, but designed to also function in cloud/virtual gaming environments (such as GeForceNOW).  
The application allows you to quickly capture item screenshots, extract text via OCR, and fetch market prices (for both PoE 1 and 2). Profiles, search history, simple local config, and robust error handling are all included.

## Description

### Overview

- Capture item info from your game screen and quickly check PoE community trade prices.

- Built to work reliably even in cloud gaming environments that restrict system access.
- All critical processes (OCR, screenshot, querying) are automatically supervised with robust recoveries.
- Simple extensibility for future overlay mode, new OCR engines, and possible additional languages.
